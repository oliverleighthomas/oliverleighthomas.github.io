Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Oliver Thomas, and I am a student at FIEA on the programming track. There, I serve as lead programmer for my capstone team, Get In The Box Studios.

My primary focus as a programmer is on NPC AI, but I am also interested in optimization strategies and system design. When I'm not working on one of my projects (which you can read about by clicking the link above!), I like to play horror games and knit!

If you want to reach out and chat, please connect with me through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-thomas-872bb71b4), or <a href="mailto:oliverthomas664@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a>. Thanks for visiting!
